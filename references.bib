  abstract  = {The algebra of dual quantities is applied in this chapter to kinematic analysis. The fundamental problem of determining the parameters of both the finite screw and the instant screw of a rigid body under general motion is used to illustrate the power of dual algebra in kinematics. It is shown that the calculation of these parameters reduces essentially to a sum of the diagonal entries and to the differences of the off-diagonal entries of the associated dual matrix.},
